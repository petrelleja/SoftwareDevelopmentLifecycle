# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are what an end user of a program is actually looking to accomplish by using the program. In a Scrum Team, a Product Owner would get user feedback to generate user stories, which are scenarios of users interacting and accomplishing tasks with the program. These user stories will be beneficial in communicating a user's primary needs from a program and what the development team's goals will be for the current Sprint of a program. After that Sprint, the user's needs would be implemented into the program.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I always approach developing a program by creating a plan. Before actually coding, a plan usually means creating pseudocode and/or a flowchart to plan out the logic and flow of a program. This ensures that there is a step by step process for the goals of this sprint to be met and leads to a more efficient work process. Some agile processes that I would incorporate into my future development work would be the process of estimation, the daily scrum meetings, and the sprint retrospective. Estimation practices such as velocity or planning poker would let the team share their thoughts and look at past projects to create a more accurate representation of when a project would be completed. If there are multiple people working on a project, then the daily scrum meetings would help keep every team member on the same page and help make sure that the project was on track for a timely completion. Finally the sprint retrospective would allow us to review how an iteration of the current project went, and reflect on where there is room for improvement.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development is present, self-organized, open, and driven. They participate in the collaborative process of developing software and they pull their own weight. It is important that a good team member puts in the work on their role. As an example a tester should be focused on working with the product owner and user stories to make test cases, while developers should be focused on creating code to pass those test cases. If everyone performs their roles efficiently and effectively, then a program will come together.
